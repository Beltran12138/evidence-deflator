"""Audit 008: Polymarket's profit leaderboard, tested position by position.

Usage:
    python tools/audit_polymarket.py --cache DIR [--top 50] [--max-positions 1000] [--out FILE]

A prediction-market record has no capital series to turn into returns, so this audit does not use
the wallet check's t. It asks a different question of each resolved position: was the price paid
too low for how things turned out? Under no skill, a share bought at price p pays 1 with
probability p, so edge = outcome - p has mean 0 and variance p(1 - p).

  z_naive   = sum(edge) / sqrt(sum p(1-p))          positions treated as independent
  z_cluster = sum(edge) / sqrt(max(sum_e (sum edge in event e)^2, floor))   positions in one event share an outcome
  floor     = sum of p(1-p) over markets where only one side is held        no-skill variance

z_cluster is the headline: bets on the same event (an election, a season) are one bet, not many.
The denominator never falls below the no-skill variance. Without that floor, a wallet that
only buys favourites (price 0.85-0.99) and has not yet lost shows tiny realised edges, and the clustered
denominator shrinks with them: under no skill, 47% of such wallets with 9 events cleared z = 2, and
thirty wins bought at 0.995 scored z = 5.48, above the best-of-N bar (audit 2026-10-18). A market where
both Yes and No are held contributes nothing to the floor: one side always pays, so the equal-weighted pair
has a fixed edge. Counting it as two independent bets cut Theo4 from 2.05 to 1.36 for his hedges alone.
Positions are equal-weighted (one position, one observation); the dollar-weighted edge is reported
alongside. avgPrice is the average buy price, so positions partly sold before resolution are
scored on what was bought. Resolved positions come from two lists: closed-positions (sold or
redeemed) and positions with redeemable = true (resolved, never redeemed: mostly losers). A wallet
counts only if neither list hit --max-positions; capped wallets are reported and excluded.

Public endpoints (no key): data-api.polymarket.com/v1/leaderboard and /closed-positions.
The leaderboard reaches about 10,050 wallets and reports no total, so the best-of-N bar is computed
for N = 10,050, a floor: the true N is larger and its bar higher.
